# vue3-render-paint-flashing

_Itâ€™s important to note that the Render Paint Flashing Plugin is designed to work exclusively in Vue development mode._

A Vue 3 plugin that enhances component development by visually indicating re-renders on the screen. The Render Paint Flashing Plugin highlights components that are being re-rendered during the development process. It is a helpful tool for identifying performance bottlenecks and optimizing your Vue applications.

## Motivation

Inspired by the Chrome DevTools Rendering paint flashing panel, the Render Paint Flashing Plugin aims to optimize performance in Vue applications. By visually highlighting re-rendered components, developers gain valuable insights into potential performance bottlenecks.

## API

### `createRenderPaintFlashingPlugin()`

The `createRenderPaintFlashingPlugin` function is the main entry point for using the Render Paint Flashing Plugin. It returns a Vue plugin object that can be installed in your Vue 3 application.

```javascript
import { createApp } from 'vue';

const app = createApp(...);

if (process.env.NODE_ENV === 'development') {
  import('vue3-render-paint-flashing').then(({ createRenderPaintFlashingPlugin }) => {
    app.use(createRenderPaintFlashingPlugin());
  });
}

app.mount('#app');
```
